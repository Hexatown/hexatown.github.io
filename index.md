## Found it kind of hard to achieve the goal?
Even in just a slightly larger scale than here, like your companies suite of collaboration tools? Why not share your own best practices with peers from other companies?  Why not take it the step further, and share your ideas, texts even the "code" behind.

## Learn to use PowerApps, Flow and Logic Apps
We are working within areas as

- Process Documentation
- Test cases
- Automation scripts

Head over to [GitHub](https://www.github.com/hexatown) and start exploring and sharing.
